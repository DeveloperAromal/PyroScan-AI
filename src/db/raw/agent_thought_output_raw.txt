Agent Action: Tool='_Exception', Input='Invalid Format: Missing 'Action:' after 'Thought:', Log='Thought: Based on the gathered data, I can now make predictions for both locations. The Amazon Rainforest has high temperature and moderate humidity, with historical wildfire reports, indicating a risk. The California Wildlands have high temperature, very low humidity, and moderate wind speeds, along with historical wildfire reports, suggesting a higher risk.
